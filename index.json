However, the impact of cameras on detected individuals-such as from mechanical noise, odor, and emitted light-has received relatively little attention. These impacts are particularly important in behavioral studies in conservation that seek to ascribe changes in behavior to relevant environmental factors. In this article, we discuss three sources of bias that are relevant to conservation behavior studies using CTs: (a) disturbance caused by cameras; (b) variation in animal-detection parameters across camera models; and (c) biased detection across individuals and age, sex, and behavioral classes. We propose several recommendations aimed at mitigating responses to CTs by wildlife. Our recommendations offer a platform for the development of more rigorous and robust behavioral studies using CT technology and, if adopted, would result in greater applied benefits for conservation and management.","tags":[],"title":"A review of factors to consider when using camera traps to study animal behavior to inform wildlife ecology and conservation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I grew up in the South Wales valleys and I loved nature as a kid. That\u0026rsquo;s shocking information, I know, particularly coming from a biologist, but I offer no apologies; it is what it is. I was a pretty good kid, too, by all accounts, and I had an insatiable appetite for all things related to the natural world. I remember, of course, the Attenborough documentaries, but also being absolutely hooked on Disney\u0026rsquo;s White Wilderness, which I had on VHS (go and ask your parents). Unsurprisingly, I knew that I wanted to work with animals when I grew up,1 or, even better, become a palaeontologist. Because dinosaurs!\nAnd so it went that I grew up, discovered sci-fi, Lego, rugby, cartoons and, slowly, the natural world and I drifted apart. Eventually, the impacts of a careers tutor who said that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford for me to go to University and the after-effects of an abusive father resulted in an enrolment in art college where I studyied 2D animation. After that, I worked in IT for my local council while doing acting classes and improvisational comedy of an evening. After 3 years of phone calls with word processing operators who couldn\u0026rsquo;t use a word processor, I decided it was time to follow my dream and become a wandering minstrel. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work out, so I settled for heading to University to study conservation.\nBangor University in North Wales were good enough to offer me a place on a BSc course, despite it being nearly a decade since I\u0026rsquo;d last studied science or math(s; choose your variant). I\u0026rsquo;d gone into my undergrad hoping for a 2:2 and to get work in practical conservation on a local reserve. Instead, I received a first class degree and realised that research is kind of cool and resolved to do more of that, if I could.\nAnd then began the first of the Barren Years. Terrible letters were sent as PhDs were sought; all were rejected without an interview.\nTwelve months later I enrolled on a Master\u0026rsquo;s-by-Research (MRes) course at the University of Leeds, reasoning that the two research projects I would undertake would stand me in good stead for a future PhD. I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that I was less enthusiastic about that course. The research (bird ecology and ant genetics) was awesome, but the modules repeated much of my undergrad material. Nevertheless, regardless and, indeed, anyway, I emerged with a postgrad degree and embarked upon the second Barren Year.\nI\u0026rsquo;d learned a lot during my Master\u0026rsquo;s studies, and my cover letters improved dramatically. As a result, my PhD applications were increasingly successful. Six months later, I received a couple of offers and, another six months down the line, I was in Belfast. The PhD was hard(!); I had to up my game in all aspects. My peers were largely nice people but I had little in common with them and struggled with social events. My personal life was a total mess, too - my seven-year relationship collapsed and for much of the second and part of the third year, I lurched from crisis to crisis. I was a gnat\u0026rsquo;s breath from quitting at one point and impostor syndrome was (and remains) an almost constant companion. Luckily, I had an excellent supervisor and doing the PhD remains one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\nThree and a half years later, I graduated. In contrast to others in the office, I found the whole graduation process underwhelming. You spend months writing the thesis, there\u0026rsquo;s the wait for the viva, then the corrections, then the eventual graduation some months later. But still, the little kid who wanted to work with animals was ecstatic.\nAnd then began the third Barren Year.\nI started applying for postdocs around 3 months out from the end of my PhD. Over the next 18 months I had over 20 interviews, getting close a total of 14 times. I kept working on papers and other projects in the meantime, but I was slowly being worn down. The only bright spot of this time was meeting my partner - now wife! - Kim, who is one of the most ridiculous people I have ever met. I mean that in a truly loving way. I finally received an offer of a position from University College Cork.\nThe postdoc went very well, indeed. I worked with an excellent team and made some good friends. I knew that we were almost certainly going to have to move again and I was looking for something more permanent, as Kim was pregnant and neither of us were keen on the uncertainty that\u0026rsquo;s inherent in chasing postdoc positions. Towards the end of my contract, a couple of friends (who are a couple) let me know about a lecturer position that had opened up at the University of South Wales. The job was, amazingly enough, in the building that used to be the art college I attended. It seemed a perfect fit, came at just the right time, and management were (and are) extremely supportive of early career researchers who were looking for their first academic position. It was remarkably fortunate timing.\nI\u0026rsquo;m now about a year and a half into my lectureship and it seems utterly bizarre to think that I am a professional scientist. My mother still says that she can\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\nThere should be a lesson here, right? I\u0026rsquo;ve left out a lot of information - the personal demons, the sacrifices, the self-funding much of my undergrad and Master\u0026rsquo;s from savings and backup jobs, the many, many people who supported and helped me - and yes, there are plenty of things I could say as words of advice. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the point of this post. I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure what the point of this post is, to be honest, except to say that this is where one particular scientist, where I, came from. \u0026quot;\n The original version of this post was featured on the Errant Science blog . That was 3 years ago. This version has been edited and updated.\n  Growing up is a myth, and don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1591641450,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591641450,"objectID":"db2c395583a858dbdc3560de378bc21a","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/post/introduction/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T19:37:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/introduction/","section":"post","summary":"I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post is, to be honest, except to say that this is where one particular scientist, where I, came from.","tags":[],"title":"A career profile, of sorts","type":"post"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Sandra Irwin","John Lusby","Marc Ruddock","Allan Mee","Tony Nagle","Lorcan O'Toole","Shane O'Neill","John O'Halloran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585267200,"objectID":"7a8f63d1855e18bf567df4002a2d1461","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-anthropogenic-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-anthropogenic-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We used text mining, mixed-effects models, principal component analysis and clustering methods to explore anthropogenic pressures on suitable breeding and foraging habitats for Hen Harriers in Ireland, based on the 2015 national breeding Hen Harrier survey data.Mixed-effects models described a strong influence of agriculture, forestry, predator activity, and recreational activities on survey areas that contained Hen Harrier territories.

However, there are currently a dozen definitions of rewilding that include Pleistocene rewilding, island rewilding, trophic rewilding, functional rewilding and passive rewilding, and these remain fuzzy, lack clarity and, hence, hinder scientific discourse. Based on current definitions, it is unclear how the interventions described under the rewilding umbrella differ from those framed within the long-standing term ‘restoration’. Even projects held up as iconic rewilding endeavours invariably began as restoration projects (e.g., Oostvaaderplassen; Pleistocene Park; the return of wolves to Yellowstone, etc.). Similarly, rewilding organisations (e.g., Rewilding Europe) typically began with a restoration focus. Scientific discourse requires precise language. The fuzziness of existing definitions of rewilding and lack of distinction from restoration practices means that scientific messages cannot be transferred accurately to a policy or practice framework. We suggest that the utility of ‘rewilding’ as a term is obsolete, and hence recommend scientists and practitioners use ‘restoration’ instead.","tags":["Assisted colonisation","Conservation translocation","Ecological equivalent species","Ecological replacement","Island","Novel ecosystems","Pleistocene","Reinforcement","Reintroduction","Restoration","Restore","Rewilding"],"title":"Reintroducing rewilding to restoration – Rejecting the search for novelty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Richard J.

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance.

Inappropriate diets can lead to a number of nutritional deficiencies and increase the risk of disease and obesity. Ruffed lemurs are the most intensely frugivorous of extant lemur species. Captive animals, however, are often fed a diet which may not accurately reflect the composition of the wild diet. As such, the species is prone to obesity and can suffer from nutrition-related diseases. Here we describe the historical diets of several captive populations of ruffed lemurs in the UK, describing differences in nutritional content with a particular focus on the problems of obesity and iron storage disease. Dietary data were collected from six zoological institutions. Comparative analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the amount metabolisable energy, carbohydrates, sugar and iron provisioned per individual, between institutions. The results showed that the composition of captive ruffed lemur diets, and the amount of food offered, differed between institutions. All dietary analytes showed significant variation, with metabolisable energy exceeding suggested maintenance energy requirements at all institutions. One population was found to be obese, and two institutions reported mortalities where excessive iron accumulation and iron storage disease was observed. These data represent an important addition to the literature as they describe historical inconsistencies in the diets of captive ruffed lemurs. Given the degree of variation in diet, morphology, physiology, and oro-rectal through-time amongst nonhuman primates, and the evidence of obesity and disease presented herein, the development of species-specific diets is long overdue. Zoos can use our data to inform the development of appropriate contemporary diets, thus improving captive ruffed lemur condition and wellbeing.","tags":["disease","frugivores","fruit","husbandry","primates","vegetables"],"title":"The composition of captive ruffed lemur (Varecia spp.) diets in UK zoological collections, with reference to the problems of obesity and iron storage disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"459a0b85b7d05b48517a9e8cb39546b1","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.815729Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lagomorpha Life History","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"de246318ca4e3803b2700e7b06549cec","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.813227Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lagomorpha Navigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan P.

We used Ecological Niche Modelling and Principal Components Analysis of bioclimatic and habitat variables to describe the extent of the species niche, and degrees of bioclimatic–habitat niche conservatism within the mountain hare (L. timidus) clade. Mountain hare niche space was contrasted with that of the European hare (L. europaeus), to shed light on species interactions in contact zones throughout Europe. All five subspecies of mountain hare had quantifiably distinct niches. Fennoscandian (L.t. sylvaticus, L.t. timidus) and highland (L.t. scoticus, L.t. varronis) subspecies, however, were most similar, exhibiting greatest apparent niche conservatism. They inhabit tundra, boreal forest and uplands, and, hence are presumed most similar to the ancestral form. The Irish hare was distinct, being consistently distinguished from other mountain hares in both 2D and nth dimensional (4D) niche space. The ecological distinctiveness of the Irish hare provides further evidence that it is an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, particularly vulnerable to displacement by introduced European hares with which it competes and hybridises. Projections under global climate change suggest that, by 2070, bioclimatic space for invasive European hares in Ireland will expand (by 79%) but contract for endemic Irish hares (by 75%), further facilitating their replacement. The near complete species replacement of the heath hare (L.t. sylvaticus) in southern Sweden, where the European hare has also been introduced, may suggest a similar fate may be in store for the Irish hare.","tags":["Environmental Niche Modelling","Invasion biology","Lepus","Niche conservatism","Principal Components Analysis","Species Distribution Model"],"title":"Niche overlap of mountain hare subspecies and the vulnerability of their ranges to invasion by the European hare; the (bad) luck of the Irish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Peter B.

However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.","tags":["Anthropogenic impacts","behavioural indicators","ethology","management","monitoring","remote sensing"],"title":"A review of camera trapping for conservation behaviour research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J O'Halloran","TC Kelly","JL Quinn","S Irwin","D.

The European hare (Lepus europaeus) is a non-native invasive species, now established in Northern Ireland. The European hare impacts the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus), a priority species of conservation concern, via competition and hybridisation to the extent that control of European hares is a priority. We conducted a questionnaire survey among members of Countryside Alliance Ireland (CAI)—an organisation that promotes rural interests, including field sports—and non-members, to ascertain the contrasting attitudes to the lethal control of European hares in Northern Ireland; a total of 342 (20%) questionnaires were returned. We hypothesised that: (i) CAI members would exhibit greater support for intervention than non-members; and (ii) respondents in the core invasive range will differ in their outlook when compared to respondents from other zones. CAI members were more likely to be aware of the presence of the non-native species and to support lethal management. Both groups considered the threat posed to biodiversity by the European hare to be important. We conclude that members of rural interest groups may be important advocates of intervention, whilst non-members of field sports organisations may be more reluctant to support any proposed management plan involving lethal control. Active engagement to develop a mutual understanding, prior to developing management options, is crucial in ensuring long-term success.","tags":null,"title":"Management and control of invasive brown hares (Lepus europaeus): contrasting attitudes of selected environmental stakeholders and the wider rural community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"88fa12c6c84f00ff08e3b6649fc98b2d","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-remboot-2017/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.824235Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-remboot-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"remBoot: An R package for Random Encounter Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Marco Zaccaroni","Francesco Riga","Stéphanie C.

We deploy REMs to describe an invasive-native species replacement process, and to demonstrate their wider application beyond abundance estimation. The Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus is a high priority endemic of conservation concern. It is threatened by an expanding population of nonnative, European hares L. europaeus, an invasive species of global importance. Camera traps were deployed in thirteen 1 km squares, wherein the ratio of invader to native densities were corroborated by night-driven line transect distance sampling throughout the study area of 1652 km2. Spatial patterns of invasive and native densities between the invader's core and peripheral ranges, and native allopatry, were comparable between methods. Native densities in the peripheral range were comparable to those in native allopatry using REM, or marginally depressed using Distance Sampling. Numbers of the invader were substantially higher than the native in the core range, irrespective of method, with a 5:1 invader-to-native ratio indicating species replacement. We also describe a post hoc optimization protocol for REM which will inform subsequent (re-)surveys, allowing survey effort (camera hours) to be reduced by up to 57% without compromising the width of confidence intervals associated with density estimates. This approach will form the basis of a more cost-effective means of surveillance and monitoring for both the endemic and invasive species. The European hare undoubtedly represents a significant threat to the endemic Irish hare.","tags":["Density estimation","Lepus","camera traps","distance sampling","invasive species","random encounter models"],"title":"An invasive-native mammalian species replacement process captured by camera trap survey random encounter models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","W.

In southern Sweden, it replaces the native mountain hare (L. timidus) through competition and hybridisation. We investigated temporal change in the invasive range of the European hare in Ireland, and compared its habitat use with the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus). The range of the European hare was three times larger and its core range twice as large in 2012–2013 than in 2005. Its rate of radial range expansion was 0.73 km year−1 with its introduction estimated to have occurred ca. 1970. Both species utilised improved and rough grasslands and exhibited markedly similar regression coefficients with almost every land cover variable examined. Irish hares were associated with low fibre and high sugar content grass (good quality grazing) whilst the invader had a greater tolerance for low quality forage. European hares were associated with habitat patch edge density, suggesting it may be more suited to using hedgerows as diurnal resting sites than the Irish hare. Consequently, the invader had a wider niche breadth than the native but their niche overlap was virtually complete. Given the impact of the European hare on native species elsewhere, and its apparent pre-adaption for improved grasslands interspersed with arable land (a habitat that covers 70 % of Ireland), its establishment and range expansion poses a significant threat to the ecological security of the endemic Irish hare, particularly given their ecological similarities.","tags":["Invasive alien species","Niche overlap","Spatial ecology","Species replacement"],"title":"Range expansion and comparative habitat use of insular, congeneric lagomorphs: invasive European hares Lepus europaeus and endemic Irish hares Lepus timidus hibernicus","type":"publication"}]
