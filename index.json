To develop effective mitigation strategies, the relative hazard a species poses to aircraft, as well as information relating to its life history, are key to the development of effective mitigation strategies in Wildlife Hazard Management Plans. However, given the complex nature of airfield environments with access restrictions and the presence of sensitive equipment, the collection of high-quality ecological data can be difficult. Here we use motion-activated camera traps to collect activity data on a population of Irish hares (Lepus timidus hibernicus) inhabiting the airfield at Dublin International Airport, to investigate the link between hare activity and aircraft activity in relation to hare strikes. Camera traps revealed that the hare population at the airfield largely displayed a bimodal crepuscular activity pattern, with activity peaking at sunrise and at sunset. Recorded hare strike times at the airfield were closely associated with hare activity times with a high temporal overlap between these datasets. In comparison, hare activity and aircraft movement activity had a moderate overlap across all seasons, with strikes peaking at times with low aircraft movements. We demonstrate the importance of understanding the circadian and seasonal activity patterns of hazardous species at airfields for targeted strike mitigation.","tags":null,"title":"Ball_hareport_2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan McCarthy","Pat Smiddy","Tony Nagle","Allan Mee","Sandra Irwin","Anthony Caravaggi","John O'Halloran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1660552286,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660552286,"objectID":"14c5aeba480e6ac8cfdf1289891d663c","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/mccarthy_hhdiet_2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-15T09:31:26+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mccarthy_hhdiet_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Capsule: Habitat composition plays a key role in determining the winter diet of the Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus, which varies across the winter season and between years. Aims: To determine the winter diet of the Hen Harrier and examine temporal and spatial variations in diet composition. Methods: A total of 1117 Hen Harrier pellets were collected from 11 winter roosts between 2017 and 2021 in Ireland. Results: Hen Harrier winter diet was dominated by avian prey (95.9% of pellets), with mammalian prey found in 12.0% of pellets. The occurrence of small birds and small mammals in the diet was positively associated with the proportion of arable, wild bird cover, and low-intensity agriculture around the roost sites. The frequency of medium-sized birds (primarily Redwing Turdus iliacus and Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago) in the diet was positively associated with the proportion of bog and young conifer forests surrounding roost sites. Diet varied across regions, with pellets from roosts in lowland coastal areas having a greater prevalence of small birds and small mammals, and pellets from roosts in upland areas having a greater prevalence of medium-sized birds. The proportion of medium-sized birds in the diet changed across months, with that of small birds and small mammals remaining stable. There was also variation between winters in the proportion of small- and medium-sized birds in the diet. Conclusions: Habitat, along with region and time, are important drivers of variation in Hen Harrier diet. Our findings highlight the opportunity for the enhancement of Hen Harrier habitat through land management, and can be used to inform effective conservation strategies for wintering Hen Harriers at a landscape scale.","tags":[],"title":"Mccarthy_hhdiet_2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Izar Aximoff","Dione Sales","Ennio Painkow","Gonzalo Barquero","Clarissa Rosa","Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1642771731,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642771731,"objectID":"c4760381c2ee5c2cdb1c436ccd84ab9c","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/aximoff-pantanal-cat-2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T13:28:51Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aximoff-pantanal-cat-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The biogeographical and natural history of the Leopardus colocola braccatus (Carnivora, Felidae), known as Brazilian pampas cat, including its coat colouration are poorly understood.

We obtained in total eight records of melanistic individuals in three protected areas: one site was located in the Atlantic Forest and two sites in the Cerrado (all located in Mato Grosso do Sul state). Despite the long-term camera trap survey (29,000 nights of camera traps), only 16% of the records were of Brazilian pampas cat showing polymorphic phenotypes.

(Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13516) described the development and application of a wire foot snare trap for the capture of jaguars Panthera onca and cougars Puma concolor. Snares are a commonly used and effective means of studying large carnivores. However, the article presented insufficient information to replicate the work and inadequate consideration and description of animal welfare considerations, thereby risking the perpetuation of poor standards of reporting.2. Appropriate animal welfare assessments are essential in studies that collect data from animals, especially those that use invasive techniques, and are key in assisting researchers to choose the most appropriate capture method. It is critical that authors detail all possible associated harms and benefits to support thorough review, including equipment composition, intervention processes, general body assessments, injuries (i.e. cause, type, severity) and post-release behaviour. We offer a detailed discussion of these shortcomings. We also discuss broader but highly relevant issues, including the capture of non-target animals and the omission of key methodological details. The level of detail provided by authors should allow the method to be properly assessed and replicated, including those that improve trap selectivity and minimize or eliminate the capture of non-target animals. Finally, we discuss the central role that journals must play in ensuring that published research conforms to ethical, animal welfare and reporting standards. Scientific studies are subject to ever-increasing scrutiny by peers and the public, making it more important than ever that standards are upheld and reviewed. We conclude that the proposal of a new or refined method must be supported by substantial contextual discussion, a robust rationale and analyses and comprehensive documentation.","tags":[],"title":"On the need for rigorous and robust standards for studies that involve the live-capture of large mammals: a response to de Araujo et al","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Izar Aximoff","John P Medcraft","Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632230748,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632230748,"objectID":"ec5c9f152921b50918a7c1ac319fbbbb","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/aximoff-nonvolant-mammals-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T13:25:48Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aximoff-nonvolant-mammals-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The state of Paraiba is one of those with the most degraded Caatinga that presents the large gap of knowledge concerning the mammal fauna.

The richness of non-volant mammals found represents 35.6 % of the total number of such species in the Caatinga. This species richness is greater than that found in other studies in the state. The presence of these mammal species was mainly due to the recovering vegetation that resulted from the great planting effort and also due to cessation of hunt, cattle and sheep breeding that had existed on the farm for over thirty years.

Understanding the frequency of these collisions, the identity of species involved, and the potential damage that can be inflicted on to aircraft aid mitigation efforts by airfield managers. A record of all animal carcasses recovered from Dublin International Airport, Ireland’s largest civil aviation airport, has been maintained since 1990 where strikes with the endemic Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus), a protected subspecies of mountain hare, are of particular concern despite substantial management efforts from the airfield authority. The first strike event with a hare was recorded in 1997, and strike events have substantially increased since then, with a sharp increase recorded in 2011. Over a 30-year period, a total of 320 strike events with the Irish hare have been recorded at the airfield. To date, no strike event with a hare has resulted in damage to an aircraft. However, carcasses can present as a major attraction to avian scavenger species in addition to posing as a risk of causing foreign object damage in the event of an undetected carcass. Hare strikes are discussed in the context of the rate of civil aircraft movements, possible direct and indirect damage to aircraft, and airfield wildlife hazard management. Here, we demonstrate that not only are strike events increasing by 14% on an annual basis, but that the kinetic energy of such an event has the potential to cause significant damage to an aircraft.","tags":[],"title":"Hares in the long grass: increased aircraft related mortality of the Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus) over a thirty-year period at Ireland’s largest civil airport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Bishop","Thomas Dalrymple","Jeremy A Smith","Richard F Facey","Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1626873929,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626873929,"objectID":"dcbf6a574bb218ed4f1887d0227e58cd","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/bishop-avocets-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-21T13:25:29Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bishop-avocets-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The Newport Wetlands National Nature Reserve holds Wales’ only breeding colony of Pied Avocets Recurvirostra avosetta.

However, drawbacks of traditional face-to-face (F2F) conferences, such as the ostensible exclusion of non-scientists, the substantial environmental footprint, and the large costs in terms of both time and money are increasingly being recognized. As a result, alternative and complementary formats are being explored. One of these is the Twitter conference (TC), in which research is presented and discussed on the social media platform Twitter. Here, we use hashtag and presenter data from several ornithology and ecology conferences (both TCs and F2F events) to explore the potential reach of the tweets and the magnitude of the difference in greenhouse gas emissions between the two conference types. We found that TCs generated greater engagement than F2F events, have the potential to reach a very large audience and result in a substantial reduction in emissions. Further, we argue that the format promotes presenter and audience diversity due to participation being flexible and virtually cost-free. While we recognize some disadvantages of this format compared to F2F events, especially in relation to the social and networking aspects of conferences, we envision that virtual events, such as TCs, will play an important role in the future of science dissemination and outreach. By embracing such opportunities, academic conferences can move towards a more inclusive and sustainable future.","tags":[],"title":"Twitter conferences as a low-carbon, far-reaching and inclusive way of communicating research in ornithology and ecology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan McCarthy","Anthony Caravaggi","Darío Fernández-Bellon","Sandra Irwin","John Lusby","John O'Halloran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613692800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613692800,"objectID":"e0ded38abb25df80a2007e1671245a6a","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/mccarthy-prey-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mccarthy-prey-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Anthropogenic land-use change, such as commercial afforestation, is a significant driver of shifts in ecological communities and species abundance. In this study, the consequences of afforestation of upland habitats for two distinct animal groups, birds and small mammals, were examined by comparing open moorland, early pre-thicket conifer forests (2–4 years post-replanting) and late pre-thicket conifer forests (6–8 years post-replanting) across 24 upland study sites in Ireland. Field data were collected using bird point counts, live trapping of small mammals and detailed vegetation surveys. A total of 17 bird species and four small mammal species were detected. Both groups showed contrasting patterns of abundance between moorland and pre-thicket forests, with bird density being higher in moorland, while small mammal abundance was higher in pre-thicket forests. Bird diversity was lowest in moorland and highest in late pre-thicket forests, while small mammal diversity was highest in moorland and lowest in late pre-thicket forests. Our study shows that afforestation can alter the abundance and community composition of bird and small mammal populations and that the consequences of land-use change associated with afforestation in upland areas vary across different taxa.

These are important considerations for airport operators that are obliged to mitigate wildlife hazards at airfields. Incidents involving mammals account for approximately 3–10% of all recorded strikes. However, relatively little research has been conducted on mammal strikes with aircraft outside of the USA. We collate mammal strike data from six major national aviation authorities and a global aircraft database and review the available scientific and grey literature. We aim to identify which mammal families are involved in strike events and how widespread the issue is on a global scale. We also aim to demonstrate the importance of consistently recording strike instances in national databases. We identified 40 families that were involved in strike events in 47 countries. Reported mammal strike events have been increasing by up to 68% annually. Chiroptera (4 families) accounted for the greatest proportion of strikes in Australia; leporids and canids in Canada, Germany and the UK; and Chiroptera (5 families) and cervids in the USA. More mammals were struck during the landing phase of an aircraft's rotation than any other phase. Circa‐diel strike risk was greatest at dusk and circa-annum strike risk was greatest during late summer, with some international variation. The total estimated cost of damage resulting from reported mammal strikes exceeded US$103 million in the USA alone, over 30 years. Mammal strikes represent a substantial risk in airfield environments. Monitoring of existing wild mammal populations is required to understand temporal trends in presence, abundance, and activity patterns and to inform management decisions. Increased and accurate reporting of strike events globally is needed to inform Wildlife Hazard Management Plans and support effective strike mitigation.","tags":[],"title":"Runway roadkill: a global review of mammal strikes with aircraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Holly English","Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608722888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608722888,"objectID":"8c70c270f092c2694a9fa7267c6cc054","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/english-wallabies-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-23T11:28:08Z","relpermalink":"/publication/english-wallabies-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Red-necked wallabies have been present in Britain for more than a century, originally being imported for zoos and private collections where they were popular attractions.

This paper brings together expert knowledge on threats to these species, across Europe. Both species are generally in decline and populations are broadly affected by the same factors, including predation, climate, habitat loss, agricultural intensification, and persecution. Despite the similarities, there were key regional differences, highlighting the need for country-specific conservation actions.

However, the impact of cameras on detected individuals-such as from mechanical noise, odor, and emitted light-has received relatively little attention. These impacts are particularly important in behavioral studies in conservation that seek to ascribe changes in behavior to relevant environmental factors. In this article, we discuss three sources of bias that are relevant to conservation behavior studies using CTs: (a) disturbance caused by cameras; (b) variation in animal-detection parameters across camera models; and (c) biased detection across individuals and age, sex, and behavioral classes. We propose several recommendations aimed at mitigating responses to CTs by wildlife. Our recommendations offer a platform for the development of more rigorous and robust behavioral studies using CT technology and, if adopted, would result in greater applied benefits for conservation and management.","tags":[],"title":"A review of factors to consider when using camera traps to study animal behavior to inform wildlife ecology and conservation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Sandra Irwin","John Lusby","Marc Ruddock","Allan Mee","Tony Nagle","Lorcan O'Toole","Shane O'Neill","John O'Halloran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585267200,"objectID":"7a8f63d1855e18bf567df4002a2d1461","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-anthropogenic-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-anthropogenic-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We used text mining, mixed-effects models, principal component analysis and clustering methods to explore anthropogenic pressures on suitable breeding and foraging habitats for Hen Harriers in Ireland, based on the 2015 national breeding Hen Harrier survey data.Mixed-effects models described a strong influence of agriculture, forestry, predator activity, and recreational activities on survey areas that contained Hen Harrier territories.

Hen Harriers typically use upland habitats such as heather moorland and bog during the summer breeding season but will also use pre-thicket coniferous forest. Extensive afforestation of upland habitats has contributed to a decline in suitable nesting and foraging habitat for breeding Hen Harriers across their range. We used data from The 2015 National Survey of Breeding Hen Harrier in Ireland, forest data sources and CORINE land class maps to explore the abundance of five broad habitat categories in areas around Hen Harrier territories. The results demonstrate a concerning lack of heath and bog habitat at landscape-scale surrounding typical Hen Harrier breeding territories in Ireland. The high proportion of habitat of poor suitability in the landscape may reduce the reproductive potential of breeding Hen Harrier pairs, ultimately impacting at the population level. We discuss these habitat mosaics in the context of forest management options that are relevant to Hen Harrier conservation. Hen Harriers are vulnerable to commercial forestry and we outline key forest management options and land-use considerations to enhance habitat suitability for breeding Hen Harriers. We provide recommendations for future study, policy and management practice aimed at protecting Hen Harriers and their habitats.","tags":null,"title":"Forest management and Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus conservation in Ireland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Farrell","PJ-M.

However, there are currently a dozen definitions of rewilding that include Pleistocene rewilding, island rewilding, trophic rewilding, functional rewilding and passive rewilding, and these remain fuzzy, lack clarity and, hence, hinder scientific discourse. Based on current definitions, it is unclear how the interventions described under the rewilding umbrella differ from those framed within the long-standing term ‘restoration’. Even projects held up as iconic rewilding endeavours invariably began as restoration projects (e.g., Oostvaaderplassen; Pleistocene Park; the return of wolves to Yellowstone, etc.). Similarly, rewilding organisations (e.g., Rewilding Europe) typically began with a restoration focus. Scientific discourse requires precise language. The fuzziness of existing definitions of rewilding and lack of distinction from restoration practices means that scientific messages cannot be transferred accurately to a policy or practice framework. We suggest that the utility of ‘rewilding’ as a term is obsolete, and hence recommend scientists and practitioners use ‘restoration’ instead.","tags":["Assisted colonisation","Conservation translocation","Ecological equivalent species","Ecological replacement","Island","Novel ecosystems","Pleistocene","Reinforcement","Reintroduction","Restoration","Restore","Rewilding"],"title":"Reintroducing rewilding to restoration – Rejecting the search for novelty","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;\rif porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;:\rprint(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne \r**Two** \rThree \r A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

In this paper we calculated the breeding success of 10 species on Gough and compared these to the breeding success of similar species on islands where there aren't any invasive mammals. We estimated that house mice are responsible for the loss of nearly 2,000,000 chicks and eggs on Gough Island, annually. Some species are more vulnerable than others but almost all were impacted. At least three species that are found nowhere else in the world, the Tristan Albatross, Atlantic Petrel, and MacGillivray's Prion are likely to become extinct in the near future if mice aren't removed from Gough.","tags":["invasive species","island restoration","population ecology","rodents","seabird conservation"],"title":"The impacts of introduced House Mice on the breeding success of nesting seabirds on Gough Island","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Maria Gatta","Marie-Claire Vallely","Kayleigh Hogg","Marianne Freeman","Erfan Fadaei","Jaimie T.

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance. Our data will be valuable in informing the development of appropriate species-specific methodologies and processes and associated policies.","tags":null,"title":"Seasonal and predator-prey effects on circadian activity of free-ranging mammals revealed by camera traps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Amy Plowman","David J.

Inappropriate diets can lead to a number of nutritional deficiencies and increase the risk of disease and obesity. Ruffed lemurs are the most intensely frugivorous of extant lemur species. Captive animals, however, are often fed a diet which may not accurately reflect the composition of the wild diet. As such, the species is prone to obesity and can suffer from nutrition-related diseases. Here we describe the historical diets of several captive populations of ruffed lemurs in the UK, describing differences in nutritional content with a particular focus on the problems of obesity and iron storage disease. Dietary data were collected from six zoological institutions. Comparative analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the amount metabolisable energy, carbohydrates, sugar and iron provisioned per individual, between institutions. The results showed that the composition of captive ruffed lemur diets, and the amount of food offered, differed between institutions. All dietary analytes showed significant variation, with metabolisable energy exceeding suggested maintenance energy requirements at all institutions. One population was found to be obese, and two institutions reported mortalities where excessive iron accumulation and iron storage disease was observed. These data represent an important addition to the literature as they describe historical inconsistencies in the diets of captive ruffed lemurs. Given the degree of variation in diet, morphology, physiology, and oro-rectal through-time amongst nonhuman primates, and the evidence of obesity and disease presented herein, the development of species-specific diets is long overdue. Zoos can use our data to inform the development of appropriate contemporary diets, thus improving captive ruffed lemur condition and wellbeing.","tags":["disease","frugivores","fruit","husbandry","primates","vegetables"],"title":"The composition of captive ruffed lemur (Varecia spp.) diets in UK zoological collections, with reference to the problems of obesity and iron storage disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"459a0b85b7d05b48517a9e8cb39546b1","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.815729Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lagomorpha Life History","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"de246318ca4e3803b2700e7b06549cec","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.813227Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lagomorpha Navigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan P.

We used Ecological Niche Modelling and Principal Components Analysis of bioclimatic and habitat variables to describe the extent of the species niche, and degrees of bioclimatic–habitat niche conservatism within the mountain hare (L. timidus) clade. Mountain hare niche space was contrasted with that of the European hare (L. europaeus), to shed light on species interactions in contact zones throughout Europe. All five subspecies of mountain hare had quantifiably distinct niches. Fennoscandian (L.t. sylvaticus, L.t. timidus) and highland (L.t. scoticus, L.t. varronis) subspecies, however, were most similar, exhibiting greatest apparent niche conservatism. They inhabit tundra, boreal forest and uplands, and, hence are presumed most similar to the ancestral form. The Irish hare was distinct, being consistently distinguished from other mountain hares in both 2D and nth dimensional (4D) niche space. The ecological distinctiveness of the Irish hare provides further evidence that it is an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, particularly vulnerable to displacement by introduced European hares with which it competes and hybridises. Projections under global climate change suggest that, by 2070, bioclimatic space for invasive European hares in Ireland will expand (by 79%) but contract for endemic Irish hares (by 75%), further facilitating their replacement. The near complete species replacement of the heath hare (L.t. sylvaticus) in southern Sweden, where the European hare has also been introduced, may suggest a similar fate may be in store for the Irish hare.","tags":["Environmental Niche Modelling","Invasion biology","Lepus","Niche conservatism","Principal Components Analysis","Species Distribution Model"],"title":"Niche overlap of mountain hare subspecies and the vulnerability of their ranges to invasion by the European hare; the (bad) luck of the Irish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Peter B.

However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.","tags":["Anthropogenic impacts","behavioural indicators","ethology","management","monitoring","remote sensing"],"title":"A review of camera trapping for conservation behaviour research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J O'Halloran","TC Kelly","JL Quinn","S Irwin","D.

The European hare (Lepus europaeus) is a non-native invasive species, now established in Northern Ireland. The European hare impacts the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus), a priority species of conservation concern, via competition and hybridisation to the extent that control of European hares is a priority. We conducted a questionnaire survey among members of Countryside Alliance Ireland (CAI)—an organisation that promotes rural interests, including field sports—and non-members, to ascertain the contrasting attitudes to the lethal control of European hares in Northern Ireland; a total of 342 (20%) questionnaires were returned. We hypothesised that: (i) CAI members would exhibit greater support for intervention than non-members; and (ii) respondents in the core invasive range will differ in their outlook when compared to respondents from other zones. CAI members were more likely to be aware of the presence of the non-native species and to support lethal management. Both groups considered the threat posed to biodiversity by the European hare to be important. We conclude that members of rural interest groups may be important advocates of intervention, whilst non-members of field sports organisations may be more reluctant to support any proposed management plan involving lethal control. Active engagement to develop a mutual understanding, prior to developing management options, is crucial in ensuring long-term success.","tags":null,"title":"Management and control of invasive brown hares (Lepus europaeus): contrasting attitudes of selected environmental stakeholders and the wider rural community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"88fa12c6c84f00ff08e3b6649fc98b2d","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-remboot-2017/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.824235Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-remboot-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"remBoot: An R package for Random Encounter Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We deploy REMs to describe an invasive-native species replacement process, and to demonstrate their wider application beyond abundance estimation. The Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus is a high priority endemic of conservation concern. It is threatened by an expanding population of nonnative, European hares L. europaeus, an invasive species of global importance. Camera traps were deployed in thirteen 1 km squares, wherein the ratio of invader to native densities were corroborated by night-driven line transect distance sampling throughout the study area of 1652 km2. Spatial patterns of invasive and native densities between the invader's core and peripheral ranges, and native allopatry, were comparable between methods. Native densities in the peripheral range were comparable to those in native allopatry using REM, or marginally depressed using Distance Sampling. Numbers of the invader were substantially higher than the native in the core range, irrespective of method, with a 5:1 invader-to-native ratio indicating species replacement. We also describe a post hoc optimization protocol for REM which will inform subsequent (re-)surveys, allowing survey effort (camera hours) to be reduced by up to 57% without compromising the width of confidence intervals associated with density estimates. This approach will form the basis of a more cost-effective means of surveillance and monitoring for both the endemic and invasive species. The European hare undoubtedly represents a significant threat to the endemic Irish hare.","tags":["Density estimation","Lepus","camera traps","distance sampling","invasive species","random encounter models"],"title":"An invasive-native mammalian species replacement process captured by camera trap survey random encounter models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","W.

In southern Sweden, it replaces the native mountain hare (L. timidus) through competition and hybridisation. We investigated temporal change in the invasive range of the European hare in Ireland, and compared its habitat use with the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus). The range of the European hare was three times larger and its core range twice as large in 2012–2013 than in 2005. Its rate of radial range expansion was 0.73 km year−1 with its introduction estimated to have occurred ca. 1970. Both species utilised improved and rough grasslands and exhibited markedly similar regression coefficients with almost every land cover variable examined. Irish hares were associated with low fibre and high sugar content grass (good quality grazing) whilst the invader had a greater tolerance for low quality forage. European hares were associated with habitat patch edge density, suggesting it may be more suited to using hedgerows as diurnal resting sites than the Irish hare. Consequently, the invader had a wider niche breadth than the native but their niche overlap was virtually complete. Given the impact of the European hare on native species elsewhere, and its apparent pre-adaption for improved grasslands interspersed with arable land (a habitat that covers 70 % of Ireland), its establishment and range expansion poses a significant threat to the ecological security of the endemic Irish hare, particularly given their ecological similarities.","tags":["Invasive alien species","Niche overlap","Spatial ecology","Species replacement"],"title":"Range expansion and comparative habitat use of insular, congeneric lagomorphs: invasive European hares Lepus europaeus and endemic Irish hares Lepus timidus hibernicus","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
