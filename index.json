However, there are currently a dozen definitions of rewilding that include Pleistocene rewilding, island rewilding, trophic rewilding, functional rewilding and passive rewilding, and these remain fuzzy, lack clarity and, hence, hinder scientific discourse. Based on current definitions, it is unclear how the interventions described under the rewilding umbrella differ from those framed within the long-standing term ‘restoration’. Even projects held up as iconic rewilding endeavours invariably began as restoration projects (e.g., Oostvaaderplassen; Pleistocene Park; the return of wolves to Yellowstone, etc.). Similarly, rewilding organisations (e.g., Rewilding Europe) typically began with a restoration focus. Scientific discourse requires precise language. The fuzziness of existing definitions of rewilding and lack of distinction from restoration practices means that scientific messages cannot be transferred accurately to a policy or practice framework. We suggest that the utility of ‘rewilding’ as a term is obsolete, and hence recommend scientists and practitioners use ‘restoration’ instead.","tags":["Assisted colonisation","Conservation translocation","Ecological equivalent species","Ecological replacement","Island","Novel ecosystems","Pleistocene","Reinforcement","Reintroduction","Restoration","Restore","Rewilding"],"title":"Reintroducing rewilding to restoration – Rejecting the search for novelty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Richard J.

In this paper we calculated the breeding success of 10 species on Gough and compared these to the breeding success of similar species on islands where there aren't any invasive mammals. We estimated that house mice are responsible for the loss of nearly 2,000,000 chicks and eggs on Gough Island, annually. Some species are more vulnerable than others but almost all were impacted. At least three species that are found nowhere else in the world, the Tristan Albatross, Atlantic Petrel, and MacGillivray's Prion are likely to become extinct in the near future if mice aren't removed from Gough.","tags":["invasive species","island restoration","population ecology","rodents","seabird conservation"],"title":"The impacts of introduced House Mice on the breeding success of nesting seabirds on Gough Island","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Maria Gatta","Marie-Claire Vallely","Kayleigh Hogg","Marianne Freeman","Erfan Fadaei","Jaimie T.

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance. Our data will be valuable in informing the development of appropriate species-specific methodologies and processes and associated policies.","tags":null,"title":"Seasonal and predator-prey effects on circadian activity of free-ranging mammals revealed by camera traps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Amy Plowman","David J.

Inappropriate diets can lead to a number of nutritional deficiencies and increase the risk of disease and obesity. Ruffed lemurs are the most intensely frugivorous of extant lemur species. Captive animals, however, are often fed a diet which may not accurately reflect the composition of the wild diet. As such, the species is prone to obesity and can suffer from nutrition-related diseases. Here we describe the historical diets of several captive populations of ruffed lemurs in the UK, describing differences in nutritional content with a particular focus on the problems of obesity and iron storage disease. Dietary data were collected from six zoological institutions. Comparative analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the amount metabolisable energy, carbohydrates, sugar and iron provisioned per individual, between institutions. The results showed that the composition of captive ruffed lemur diets, and the amount of food offered, differed between institutions. All dietary analytes showed significant variation, with metabolisable energy exceeding suggested maintenance energy requirements at all institutions. One population was found to be obese, and two institutions reported mortalities where excessive iron accumulation and iron storage disease was observed. These data represent an important addition to the literature as they describe historical inconsistencies in the diets of captive ruffed lemurs. Given the degree of variation in diet, morphology, physiology, and oro-rectal through-time amongst nonhuman primates, and the evidence of obesity and disease presented herein, the development of species-specific diets is long overdue. Zoos can use our data to inform the development of appropriate contemporary diets, thus improving captive ruffed lemur condition and wellbeing.","tags":["disease","frugivores","fruit","husbandry","primates","vegetables"],"title":"The composition of captive ruffed lemur (Varecia spp.) diets in UK zoological collections, with reference to the problems of obesity and iron storage disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"459a0b85b7d05b48517a9e8cb39546b1","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.815729Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lagomorpha Life History","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"de246318ca4e3803b2700e7b06549cec","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.813227Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-lagomorpha-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lagomorpha Navigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan P.

We used Ecological Niche Modelling and Principal Components Analysis of bioclimatic and habitat variables to describe the extent of the species niche, and degrees of bioclimatic–habitat niche conservatism within the mountain hare (L. timidus) clade. Mountain hare niche space was contrasted with that of the European hare (L. europaeus), to shed light on species interactions in contact zones throughout Europe. All five subspecies of mountain hare had quantifiably distinct niches. Fennoscandian (L.t. sylvaticus, L.t. timidus) and highland (L.t. scoticus, L.t. varronis) subspecies, however, were most similar, exhibiting greatest apparent niche conservatism. They inhabit tundra, boreal forest and uplands, and, hence are presumed most similar to the ancestral form. The Irish hare was distinct, being consistently distinguished from other mountain hares in both 2D and nth dimensional (4D) niche space. The ecological distinctiveness of the Irish hare provides further evidence that it is an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, particularly vulnerable to displacement by introduced European hares with which it competes and hybridises. Projections under global climate change suggest that, by 2070, bioclimatic space for invasive European hares in Ireland will expand (by 79%) but contract for endemic Irish hares (by 75%), further facilitating their replacement. The near complete species replacement of the heath hare (L.t. sylvaticus) in southern Sweden, where the European hare has also been introduced, may suggest a similar fate may be in store for the Irish hare.","tags":["Environmental Niche Modelling","Invasion biology","Lepus","Niche conservatism","Principal Components Analysis","Species Distribution Model"],"title":"Niche overlap of mountain hare subspecies and the vulnerability of their ranges to invasion by the European hare; the (bad) luck of the Irish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Peter B.

However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.","tags":["Anthropogenic impacts","behavioural indicators","ethology","management","monitoring","remote sensing"],"title":"A review of camera trapping for conservation behaviour research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J O'Halloran","TC Kelly","JL Quinn","S Irwin","D.

The European hare (Lepus europaeus) is a non-native invasive species, now established in Northern Ireland. The European hare impacts the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus), a priority species of conservation concern, via competition and hybridisation to the extent that control of European hares is a priority. We conducted a questionnaire survey among members of Countryside Alliance Ireland (CAI)—an organisation that promotes rural interests, including field sports—and non-members, to ascertain the contrasting attitudes to the lethal control of European hares in Northern Ireland; a total of 342 (20%) questionnaires were returned. We hypothesised that: (i) CAI members would exhibit greater support for intervention than non-members; and (ii) respondents in the core invasive range will differ in their outlook when compared to respondents from other zones. CAI members were more likely to be aware of the presence of the non-native species and to support lethal management. Both groups considered the threat posed to biodiversity by the European hare to be important. We conclude that members of rural interest groups may be important advocates of intervention, whilst non-members of field sports organisations may be more reluctant to support any proposed management plan involving lethal control. Active engagement to develop a mutual understanding, prior to developing management options, is crucial in ensuring long-term success.","tags":null,"title":"Management and control of invasive brown hares (Lepus europaeus): contrasting attitudes of selected environmental stakeholders and the wider rural community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Caravaggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"88fa12c6c84f00ff08e3b6649fc98b2d","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/caravaggi-remboot-2017/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T11:53:20.824235Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caravaggi-remboot-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"remBoot: An R package for Random Encounter Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","Marco Zaccaroni","Francesco Riga","Stéphanie C.

We deploy REMs to describe an invasive-native species replacement process, and to demonstrate their wider application beyond abundance estimation. The Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus is a high priority endemic of conservation concern. It is threatened by an expanding population of nonnative, European hares L. europaeus, an invasive species of global importance. Camera traps were deployed in thirteen 1 km squares, wherein the ratio of invader to native densities were corroborated by night-driven line transect distance sampling throughout the study area of 1652 km2. Spatial patterns of invasive and native densities between the invader's core and peripheral ranges, and native allopatry, were comparable between methods. Native densities in the peripheral range were comparable to those in native allopatry using REM, or marginally depressed using Distance Sampling. Numbers of the invader were substantially higher than the native in the core range, irrespective of method, with a 5:1 invader-to-native ratio indicating species replacement. We also describe a post hoc optimization protocol for REM which will inform subsequent (re-)surveys, allowing survey effort (camera hours) to be reduced by up to 57% without compromising the width of confidence intervals associated with density estimates. This approach will form the basis of a more cost-effective means of surveillance and monitoring for both the endemic and invasive species. The European hare undoubtedly represents a significant threat to the endemic Irish hare.","tags":["Density estimation","Lepus","camera traps","distance sampling","invasive species","random encounter models"],"title":"An invasive-native mammalian species replacement process captured by camera trap survey random encounter models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Caravaggi","W.

In southern Sweden, it replaces the native mountain hare (L. timidus) through competition and hybridisation. We investigated temporal change in the invasive range of the European hare in Ireland, and compared its habitat use with the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus). The range of the European hare was three times larger and its core range twice as large in 2012–2013 than in 2005. Its rate of radial range expansion was 0.73 km year−1 with its introduction estimated to have occurred ca. 1970. Both species utilised improved and rough grasslands and exhibited markedly similar regression coefficients with almost every land cover variable examined. Irish hares were associated with low fibre and high sugar content grass (good quality grazing) whilst the invader had a greater tolerance for low quality forage. European hares were associated with habitat patch edge density, suggesting it may be more suited to using hedgerows as diurnal resting sites than the Irish hare. Consequently, the invader had a wider niche breadth than the native but their niche overlap was virtually complete. Given the impact of the European hare on native species elsewhere, and its apparent pre-adaption for improved grasslands interspersed with arable land (a habitat that covers 70 % of Ireland), its establishment and range expansion poses a significant threat to the ecological security of the endemic Irish hare, particularly given their ecological similarities.","tags":["Invasive alien species","Niche overlap","Spatial ecology","Species replacement"],"title":"Range expansion and comparative habitat use of insular, congeneric lagomorphs: invasive European hares Lepus europaeus and endemic Irish hares Lepus timidus hibernicus","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d8a8877a420d0c326bd7178256841aed","permalink":"https://arcaravaggi.github.io/publication/farrell-myxomatosis-2020/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/farrell-myxomatosis-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"publication"}]
